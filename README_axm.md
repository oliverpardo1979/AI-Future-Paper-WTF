# Parallel A-M paper

This part of the project leaves `main.tex` and the original model unchanged.
The parallel manuscript is `main_axm.tex`. Its baseline research technology is

$$
\dot A=\chi\left[
\omega_H H^{\varrho_{HM}}+
\omega_M(AM)^{\varrho_{HM}}
\right]^{\eta/\varrho_{HM}},
\qquad
\varrho_{HM}=\frac{\sigma_{HM}-1}{\sigma_{HM}},
$$

with no separate $A^\phi$ term. The constant-returns effective-research index inside this
equation is denoted by $E$ when useful, so the same law can be written
$\dot A=\chi E^\eta$. The index $E$ is an accounting device, not a second
production stage. The baseline maintains $0<\eta<\alpha<1$ and uses
$\eta=0.20$ with $\alpha=0.33$. For all positive CES elasticities and on every
fixed regular horizon, the stronger restriction makes the developer's objective
coercive in total research expenditure over all nonnegative research controls
and gives a finite truncated value. When both CES nests permit gross
substitution, $\eta>\alpha$ admits a fixed-duration research-compute expansion
that makes the truncated value unbounded; under the stated extension conditions,
its zero-control tail gives the same conclusion for the infinite-horizon
developer objective. At equality, the fixed-duration leading term depends on
coefficients and the boundary is not fully characterized. The coercivity result does
not provide compactness, prove attainment or global optimality,
control the infinite-horizon tail, or establish equilibrium existence. The
boundary $\eta=1$ is not covered by the current propositions.
At $\sigma_{HM}=1$, the continuous limit is
$\dot A=\chi H^{\eta\omega_H}(AM)^{\eta\omega_M}$.

Inference and research compute share a constant unit cost. The manuscript
measures both inputs in resource-expenditure units and normalizes that cost to
one; capability and research productivity are correspondingly rescaled.

## Reproduce the verified figures and audit

Install the pinned numerical and rendering packages with
`python -m pip install -r requirements-numerical.txt`. The consolidated
distribution chart uses DejaVu Sans and fails explicitly if that font is not
available, rather than silently changing the published layout.

Run `python scripts/simulate_axm_equilibrium.py` and then
`python scripts/audit_axm_model.py`. The Davidson-style feedback diagnostic is
generated separately, without rerunning the solver:

```
python scripts/plot_axm_feedback_diagnostic.py
```

The first command solves the two reported perfect-foresight path approximations and writes
their data to `numerical_axm/` and figures to `figures_axm/`. With the reported
calibration, the primary horizons are 3,100 years for $\sigma_{HM}=1$ and 5,800
years for $\sigma_{HM}=2$; the six robustness horizons are 2,600, 3,100, 3,600
and 5,400, 5,800, 6,200 years, respectively. The second command checks
the analytical benchmark calculations and rejects numerical paths whose market,
first-order, feasibility, second-order, terminal-target, or dynamic residuals
exceed the documented tolerances. It also stores and audits all six paths used in
the terminal-horizon robustness exercise. Proposition
`prop:axm-equilibrium-sufficiency` proves that any admissible exact
infinite-horizon path satisfying the full system and transversality conditions is
globally optimal under both reported unit-elasticity parameterizations. The numerical audit
verifies its finite-horizon discretization and terminal proxies; it cannot by
itself prove an infinite-horizon transversality limit or existence of the
continued path.

The audit also reconstructs the new research specification independently from
every saved observation: `AM = A*M`, the CES input index, the consolidated
capability law, both research first-order conditions, and the capability-feedback
term in the costate equation. Files in `numerical_axm/` and `figures_axm/` are the
only model-simulation artifacts used by `main_axm.tex`.
The equation-by-equation paper/code map is
`numerical_axm/equilibrium_equation_map.csv`, and the six complete robustness
paths are in `numerical_axm/equilibrium_horizon_paths.csv`.
The feedback script reads the canonical unit-elasticity paths and evaluates the
plug-in balanced-growth measure $G(t)=\eta s_M(t)(1+\nu)$ at each dated
allocation. It is not the transition Jacobian or independent numerical evidence.
Its line $G=1$ is a balanced-growth reference, not a stand-alone explosion
condition away from the limiting system.

The final-production complementarity cases use a separate runner and an
independent auditor:

```
python scripts/simulate_axm_complements_equilibrium.py
python scripts/audit_axm_complements.py
```

The runner solves the new $A\times M$ specification at
$\sigma_{XL}=0.75$, for $\sigma_{HM}=1$ and $2$, from cold starts at terminal
dates 3,600, 4,050, and 4,500. The primary paths use the 4,500-year boundary.
Only $C/Y$ and $X/(qA^2)$ are imposed at that boundary; growth rates, factor
shares, $X/L$, the research allocation, resource shares, and the interest rate
are reported rather than imposed. The independent audit imports no solver
functions, reconstructs every static equation, computes separate seven-point
dynamic residuals, checks horizon stability and finite-date TVC proxies, and
hashes all four canonical inputs. Its acceptance label is limited to
"finite-horizon candidate paths satisfying the dated equilibrium system and
the stated terminal conditions." It is not an existence theorem for an exact
infinite-horizon equilibrium.

The web-based AI Growth Lab in `docs/`, the model-simulation artifacts in
`numerical/` and `figures/`, and simulation scripts without `_axm` in their names
belong to the original specification. They must not be used as model evidence
for the parallel A-M manuscript until revalidated. The empirical evidence figure
`figures/empirical_ai_scale.png` is shared across the papers and is not a model
simulation.

`scripts/simulate_axm_high_sigma_equilibrium.py` contains the separate
free-boundary solver for $\sigma_{XL}>1$. The reported case uses
$\sigma_{XL}=1.5$ and $\sigma_{HM}=2$ and continues the terminal boundary through
$Y/K=16,32,64,128$. Reproduce the staged continuation and its audit with

```
python scripts/simulate_axm_high_sigma_equilibrium.py --assemble-published
python scripts/audit_axm_high_sigma.py
python scripts/plot_axm_high_sigma_validated.py
```

The first command starts from the unit-elasticity, $\sigma_{HM}=2$ solution,
continues first in $\sigma_{XL}$, then in the fixed horizon, and finally in the
free terminal boundary. The preliminary seed, parameter, horizon, and boundary
continuations use tolerance $3\times10^{-5}$. Starting from the resulting coarse
$Y/K=64$ solution, a second pass solves $Y/K=16,32,64,128$ sequentially at
tolerance $10^{-6}$. Only those four refined path/continuation files are written.
Use the cheap `--assemble-published --dry-run` command to inspect the exact
sequence without solving or changing any files. The full route contains 38
boundary-value solves and can take tens of minutes or longer. Run
`python scripts/audit_axm_high_sigma.py` after solving.
The independent audit reconstructs the dated equations, checks interiority and
the monopoly second-order condition, and requires convergence of the initial
jumps, paths on common pre-singular windows, terminal ratios, and estimated
singularity dates. Passing this gate licenses only the description "convergent
finite-boundary approximations to a conditional pre-singular branch satisfying
dated necessary conditions." It does not
establish an infinite-horizon equilibrium, transversality at infinity, or global
intertemporal optimality.

After all three regime-specific audits pass, generate the cross-regime
decomposition of final output with

```
python scripts/plot_axm_distribution_decomposition.py
```

This plotting-only script verifies every hash recorded in the three accepted
audit manifests before reading the canonical paths. It reconstructs the six
mutually exclusive shares from dated prices and quantities and rejects any path
whose shares are negative or fail to sum to one within the documented
tolerance. In particular, it reconstructs distributed profit \(\Pi/Y\); it does
not misinterpret the saved operating-profit field as distributed profit.

Generate the exact CES experiment used to illustrate the non-commuting limits
near \(\sigma_{XL}=1\) with

```
python scripts/plot_axm_noncommuting_limits.py
```

This command evaluates the final-production technology directly and writes the
underlying values to `numerical_axm/noncommuting_limits_technology.csv`. It does
not solve or approximate an additional equilibrium path.

Compile the manuscript from the repository root with
`tectonic --keep-logs --outdir build_axm main_axm.tex`.
